Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository
This repository contains my analyses of various data sets. I use a variety of methods to present my findings, including:

Tables: to summarize my data and findings. Tables are a quick and easy way to present large amounts of data in a clear and concise way.

Figures: to provide a visual representation that can help quickly grasp key insights from your data analysis.

Text: to explain my methods and findings in detail. Text is a good way to provide context and background information about my analyses.
