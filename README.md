# Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository

This repository contains my analyses of various data sets. I use a variety of methods to present my findings, including:

Tables: I use tables to summarize my data and findings. Tables are a quick and easy way to present large amounts of data in a clear and concise way. 

Figures: I use figures to visualize my data and findings. Figures can be more effective than tables at communicating complex relationships between variables. 

Text: I use text to explain my methods and findings in detail. Text is a good way to provide context and background information about my analyses.
